     Recenetly I came across the Japanese idea of "Ikigai" meaning "a reason for being". It does seem like a bit of an overstatement when discussing reasons I decided to start software engineering, but let me explain.
		 
     've always struggled to imagine life 3-5 years down the road. In high school I knew that I had 4 years left, and the same in college. But when I graduated with my marketing degree, I didn't know where I'd be in a few years, but it seemed obvious I couldn't work in a corportate marketing deparment. Tried teaching for a little while. It was a great experience, but that too seemed obviously unsustainable although for different reasons. 
		 
	 Ikigai is a ven diagram of all the factors that leads someone to a job or career, and it describes how these factors reate and combine achieving higher levels of fulfillment. 

		 
	 In the center of the diagram is where: 
		 
1. 		 What you love 
2. 		 What you're good at
3. 		 What the world needs
4. 		 What you can get paid for
		 
		 all meet each other and declare "a reason for being". I didn't love marketing, I'm not sure if I would be good at it, I don't think it's what the world needs, but I could certainly get paid for it. 1/4 was a non sequiter. Teaching is something I was good at, and something I could (kind of) get paid for. The world certainly needs it and I liked (not loved) it. So if the liking it and kind of getting paid for it each count as half, teaching results in 3/4 of a reason for being. Not bad, but it became clear that it wasn't going to be a long term plan. 
		 
		 I am not a high risk adverse individual, but I don't very much care to be poor. Otherwise, I would have been a broke stand up comic or out of work writer for years. I still want to pursue those things, but financial and social stability seems like a good place to start for me. In order to achieve the four descriptions to find my reason for being, I have a lot of boxes that need to be checked. I like my free time (flexibility); I like moving around (job opportunities); I like to travel and go out with friends (salary); I like taking pride in my work (self confidence) There are several other boxes but those come to mind now. I needed to find a career path using this map.
		 
		 Long story short, I met some software engineers here and there, and even though I wasn't equipped with even enough knowledge to ask good questions, I found their work and lifestyles very interesting if not super appealing. I took some cheap/free courses online and found that not only does software engineering pay well and the world needs it, but I like it and I'm good at it! (I think).
		 
		 Only time will tell if my liking grows into loving and if my having a knack grows into high level skill and ability, but so far so good and this course has only given me confidence.
