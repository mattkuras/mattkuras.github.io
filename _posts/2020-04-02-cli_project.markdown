First project in the books! That wasn't *so* bad. In fact the actual coding wasn't bad at all. It was fun! 

What *wasn't* fun was, and is, Github. You see, I was using the Learn ide for all labs up until the day I decided to begin the project, and I payed the price.

The day I began my project I remember reading the project instructions and tips,  and I quickly grew nervous. Scraping? API's? Readme's? These were things I had a tenuous grasp on at best. Which, I'd like to say, I've become quite comfortable with through this process. Many things I've learned about coding thus far didn't sink in quickly, and I had to accept that the repetition will tighten my grasp on these different concepts. And it has.

Day 1 was setting up my local environment. Which was not easy or fun. Navigating the command line is still a working process, but I did it. Looking back I wish I had been encouraged to learn github and vscode and ubuntu weeks before beginning the project. I'm comfortable now after a week of practice, but by no means a master yet. 

After setting up my local, I decided that since I had just finished the scraping labs that I'd now learn to use an API. And I gave it a shot. I really did. I watched different coaches' videos on the subject, but I greatly struggled to get started. Time was ticking I thought. I know how to scrape (kind of) let's just go with that. After several hours of initially being returned empty arrays instead of the targeted HTLM, Corinna, my cohort lead, got me on the right track. And I didn't look back. I watched the project w/ scraper walkthrough and found myself *thoroughly* enjoying completing the project. I even surprised myself figuring some things out. I knew how good it felt to implement code you believe in, and to see it work on the first try, but I was surprised to find just how good it feels to wonder how to do something, and to find the results instantly with a perfectly worded google search! Just as good!

I banged out the vast majority of code in a single day. I began with the scraper class, and like I said had some initial trouble. I believe the issue was something fairly simple. I was selecting the wrong class name and Corinna pointed it out. Once I understood how to accurately select data, I was done with the scraper class fairly quickly. It was only one web page that I had to scrape from.

Secondly, I set the html equal to instance variables. My project was based on Covid 19 statistics by country. So each country object had the instance atributes of name, total cases, total deaths, active cases, recovered cases, and current critically severe cases. With all of the objects in the class variable @@all. I was considering only displaying lists of 50 objects, but I thought it'd be more interesting to display all 206 countries. 

The CLI class was certainly the longest. We were only required to go one level deep, but I thought that was boring so I went a few levels deep. And I wanted options at different levels to jump to several levels, not just up or down one. So it was a bit of a challenge. And since I wanted to be able to navigate more than just up or down, I *quickly* noted that I was going to have to create many methods to call upon. In the program, after a user is presented with a list of countries they are promted to select one. That "choose_country" method is 30 lines of code. (I promise it has to be!) It was originally around 20 lines, but I knew I shouldn't have all those lines in all 4 list methods, so I made it a little longer, but only had to type it once! 

After the coding was basically done came the difficult, scary part. Github. I can't tell you how many different tutorials I've read on github these past days. From trying to understand cloning, forking, pushing, commiting, creating repos... it was alot to process. But I can now do what I need to do, and I intend on learning more. Corinna swears she loves github and hasn't steered me wrong yet so we'll get there!

All in all it seems like this assignment was an excellent choice for the first one. So thanks Flatiron! Let's hope the next one is even more fun !!!
